# Indian Flag Timeline App

## Stage 1: Static Skeleton

This is the first stage of the Indian Flag Timeline web application. It includes:

- A **header** containing the logo (Indian flag) and a **theme toggle** button.
- An empty **navigation** section for future filters or placeholders.
- A `<section>` with the ID `timeline` as a placeholder where timeline event markers will be added.
- A `<div>` with ID `modal` for future modal popups.
- A **main content area** using semantic HTML tags like `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and `<article>`, containing historical details and flag images from 1906 to 1947.

No JavaScript or interactivity has been added yet. This is the static structure to build upon in upcoming stages.
