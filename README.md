# Indian Flag Timeline App

## üèÅ Project Goal

To visually showcase the historical evolution of the Indian national flag from 1906 to 1947 through an interactive and accessible timeline web application. Designed to be modern, responsive, and user-friendly for all audiences.

## Stage 1: Static Skeleton

This is the first stage of the Indian Flag Timeline web application. It includes:

- A **header** containing the logo (Indian flag) and a **theme toggle** button.
- An empty **navigation** section for future filters or placeholders.
- A `<section>` with the ID `timeline` as a placeholder where timeline event markers will be added.
- A `<div>` with ID `modal` for future modal popups.
- A **main content area** using semantic HTML tags like `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and `<article>`, containing historical details and flag images from 1906 to 1947.

No JavaScript or interactivity has been added yet. This is the static structure to build upon in upcoming stages.

## Stage 2: CSS Layout & Responsive Styling

### Key Features:
- Responsive layout using **Flexbox** (with future-proofing for grid if needed)
- Base typography and color palette:
  - Clean, readable system fonts
  - Saffron-white-green gradient lines and accent colors
- Timeline design:
  - Horizontal with pill-shaped markers
